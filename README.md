# PSD-Estimation-from-Binary-Data
This repository includes a demo for the paper "Robust Spectral Estimation from Binary Neuronal Spiking Data". Algorithms 1 and 2 in the paper are implemented on our dual-tone simulated data in Section IV-A to reproduce Figure 2 of the paper. The zip file "demo.zip" includes the MATLAB demo file "main.m" as well as the simulated data.
